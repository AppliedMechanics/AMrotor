% ABRABOUT Type abrabout to print some information on screen
%
% The ABRAVIBE toolbox is an accompanying toolbox which can and should be 
% used together with the book
% Brandt, Anders: "Noise and Vibration Analysis: Signal Analysis and
% Experimental Procedures," Wiley 2011. ISBN: 13-978-0-470-74644-8.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 
% The toolbox and all its source code is FREE SOFTWARE as defined in
% the GNU GPL license. This particularly means that you are free to use
% this software without any charge at all, with some specific limitations 
% that are laid out in the license file. This file (abrabout.m) tries to
% put some basic ideas in the GNU GPL license in simpler terms, but it IS 
% the GNU GPL license file that applies!
%
% For example, YOU MAY NOT:
% (not limited to this, see license for details):
% 1. Use any part of this code in ANY software which is NOT UNDER GNU GPL.
% 2. Remove the copyright notice etc. in any file.
% 
% However, YOU MAY 
% 1. USE the code as it is, for commercial or noncommercial purposes, 
% on as many computers as you please.
% 2. CHANGE the code, as long as you do not remove the copyright
% notice, and as long as you keep information about where the code 
% originates from, and as long as you clearly document your changes.
% 3. REDISTRIBUTE the software, modified or not, as long as the license 
% file and this abrabout.m file are kept unchanged, and (thus) as long as 
% the new software (if modified) is also published under GNU GPL.
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% I publish this software in an educational spirit, to show how things
% can be done and to aid a general understanding of noise and vibration 
% analysis. Things in the code may not necessarily always be done in the 
% best possible way, so feel free to improve it! It is my sincere hope that
% you (whoever you are) will find use of this, and that you will learn
% something about the fun world of NVA!
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% I can of course not resume any responsibility for your use of this code
% and I cannot promise to respond if you have any difficulties. But I will
% try my best.
% 
% Particularly, you should know from the license file, that
% "...THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" 
% WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
% NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR 
% A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE 
% OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU 
% ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION."
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% To keep this code at a high quality level, there is a directory 'abratest'
% under the abravibe directory (or where you put the m-files). In this
% directory you can run a script called abracheck which checks major files
% in the toolbox for consistency etc. See inside that file for more details.
%
% If you find bugs in the code, I appreciate you letting me know.
