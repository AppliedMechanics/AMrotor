This is version 1.1 of the toolbox ABRAVIBE for
noise and vibration (NVH) analysis.

The most fundamental functions for spectra, FRFs etc. are verified in the test
scripts in the subdirectory ABRATEST.

At present everything is not tested in GNU/Octave. If you find something 
is not working there (or otherwise), please send me an email.

I appreciate comments, please send as documented
