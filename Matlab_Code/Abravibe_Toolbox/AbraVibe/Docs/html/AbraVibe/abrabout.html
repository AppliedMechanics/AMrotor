 The ABRAVIBE toolbox is an accompanying toolbox which can and should be 
 used together with the book
 Brandt, Anders: &quot;Noise and Vibration Analysis: Signal Analysis and
 Experimental Procedures,&quot; Wiley 2011. ISBN: 13-978-0-470-74644-8.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The toolbox and all its source code is FREE SOFTWARE as defined in
 the GNU GPL license. This particularly means that you are free to use
 this software without any charge at all, with some specific limitations 
 that are laid out in the license file. This file (abrabout.m) tries to
 put some basic ideas in the GNU GPL license in simpler terms, but it IS 
 the GNU GPL license file that applies!

 For example, YOU MAY NOT:
 (not limited to this, see license for details):
 1. Use any part of this code in ANY software which is NOT UNDER GNU GPL.
 2. Remove the copyright notice etc. in any file.
 
 However, YOU MAY 
 1. USE the code as it is, for commercial or noncommercial purposes, 
 on as many computers as you please.
 2. CHANGE the code, as long as you do not remove the copyright
 notice, and as long as you keep information about where the code 
 originates from, and as long as you clearly document your changes.
 3. REDISTRIBUTE the software, modified or not, as long as the license 
 file and this abrabout.m file are kept unchanged, and (thus) as long as 
 the new software (if modified) is also published under GNU GPL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I publish this software in an educational spirit, to show how things
 can be done and to aid a general understanding of noise and vibration 
 analysis. Things in the code may not necessarily always be done in the 
 best possible way, so feel free to improve it! It is my sincere hope that
 you (whoever you are) will find use of this, and that you will learn
 something about the fun world of NVA!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I can of course not resume any responsibility for your use of this code
 and I cannot promise to respond if you have any difficulties. But I will
 try my best.
 
 Particularly, you should know from the license file, that
 &quot;...THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; 
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
 NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR 
 A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE 
 OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU 
 ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&quot;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To keep this code at a high quality level, there is a directory 'abratest'
 under the abravibe directory (or where you put the m-files). In this
 directory you can run a script called abracheck which checks major files
 in the toolbox for consistency etc. See inside that file for more details.

 If you find bugs in the code, I appreciate you letting me know.
