============
Installation
============
:mod:`AMrotor` was tested on Matlab R2020a, but should also work with older Matlab-versions.

Necessary Matlab-toolboxes are:

* Symbolic Math Toolbox

* Curve Fitting Toolbox (for some special applications e.g. Fourierorbitdarstellung)


**********
First step
**********	

The folder of AMrotor needs to be in the Matlab-path. 
Afterwards the necessary scripts can be executed (see :ref:`Examples` and :ref:`Usage`).
