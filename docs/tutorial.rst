Tutorial
========

A very brief tutorial of a Laval-rotor should show the working principle of AMrotor. 
To get deeper into AMrotor check :ref:`Examples`.

To run a simulation with AMrotor, two scripts are necessary:

* Configuration-script, contains all the necessary parameters for the subsequent simulation.

* Simulation-script, contains the assembly and the desired analyses applied on the model.

Configuration script

.. code-block:: matlab 
  
    %% Configuration


Simulation script

    %% Simulation
