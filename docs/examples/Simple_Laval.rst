Simple laval rotor example
==========================

These are example codes (Configuration and Simulation scripts) for a simple Laval rotor simulation without active magnetic bearing (AMB). 
The code snippets can be copied and pasted completely into empty Matlab scripts or can be found 
in the AMrotor folder under "Examples".

The simulation files of Laval_Modal and Laval_Time contain different analysis methods and therefore have a different focus.
