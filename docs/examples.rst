The following examples should help to get familiar with :mod:`AMrotor` more quickly. The examples can be found (together with others) 
in the "Examples" and "Simulations" folders of the AMrotor directory.

The examples are linked to the corresponding scripts, so that changes there lead to changes in the documentation.
